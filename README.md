# Regression_with_ANNs

A Python code that performs regression in a .csv data file, from a function curve, using the concept of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), implemented with PyTorch.

After training the network, a graph is plotted with the original curve and the predicted curve, in order to compare and analyze the model results.

To run the code, type the following command in a terminal:
- python3 predict_function_ANN.py

-- Dependencies:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- pytorch
